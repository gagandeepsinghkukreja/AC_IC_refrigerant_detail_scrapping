Festival Leisure Park, Festival Way, Basildon SS14 3WB. \\nThe subject building is a modern five storey semi-detached structure located in a business park area of \\nBasildon and operates as a gymnasium comprising of two floors of which the public and staff areas are \\ntreated space. Building occpancy hours are Monday to Thursday 0530 to 2300. Friday 0530 to 2100. \\nSaturday and Sunday 0700 to 2030.   \\nThe primary aim of the Report is to give the building owner, or operator, information about the performance \\nof the system and plant and to identify opportunities to save energy and cut operating costs. This Report \\nidentifies any operating anomalies; no-cost/low-cost savings; capital investment opportunities; the size and \\nappropriateness of refrigeration plant in relation to cooling loads and the effectiveness of current \\nmaintenance regimes.\\nIncluded within this report will be a description of the air conditioning services, system efficiencies and \\napproximate sizing of the system compared to industry guidelines and suggested improvements, which \\ncould be made to increase the system efficiency. The inspection and report will benefit the owner or \\nmanager only if its findings are acted upon.\\nWhilst some items with regard to Health and Safety may have been noted, this should not be taken as a \\ncomplete Report on Health and Safety. Similarly, whilst some items may refer to replacement of life expired \\nplant, this should not be taken as a complete life cycle replacement Report.\\nThe building is cooled by :\\n5No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG140L7Y1B condensers connected to 10No. Ceiling underslung \\ncassettes with hardwired controllers.  \\n5No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG140L7Y1B condensers connected to 10No. Ceiling cassettes with \\nhardwired controllers. \\n1No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG140L7Y1B condenser connected to 1No. Ceiling cassette with \\nhardwired controller. \\n1No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG71L7Y1B condenser connected to 1No. Ceiling underslung \\ncassette with hardwired controller. \\n3No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RXS50J2V1B9 condensers connected to 3No. wall mounted cassette \\nwith hardwired controller. \\n1No. Daikin R410a inverter driven REYQ8P9Y1B VRV condenser connected to 8No. wall mounted \\ncassettes with hardwired controllers. \\nFor the purpose of the report samples have been taken in accordance with CIBSE TM44. Samples taken \\nfrom areas demonstrate  the age, condition and method of control. The Report is based on a visual \\ninspection only. No equipment or plant was removed or stripped down. Cooling requirements have been \\ncalculated in accordance with CIBSE Guides and therefore should not be treated as an in depth heat load \\ncalculation.

The internal filters were dirty \\nsuggesting the maintenance schedule requires increasing to quarterly. \\nEvidence suggests maintenance has been conducted within the manufactures guidelines.\\nThe control of the systems is adequate for current operations. However we reccomend that a central \\ncontroller is installed on site to allow timeclocking. \\nA number of opportunities are outlined within the report that should be considered to maximise efficiency. \\nWhile there is no mandatory requirement to carry out any recommendations, acting upon the advice within \\nthe report may lead to a reduction in energy consumption and operating costs.29/05/2023, 18:24 Air conditioning inspection report – Find an energy certificate – GOV .UK\\nhttps://find-energy-certificate.service.gov .uk/energy-certificate/9666-5099-0025-0590-1895?print=true 4/30Key recommendations\\nEfficiency\\n1) The systems appear appropriately sized for the cooling load.\\nMaintenance\\n1) Although some of the systems were found to contain less than 3Kg of refrigerant and are not required to\\ncomply with F-Gas regulations, good practice guidelines suggest that regular refrigerant leak checks are\\nessential to ensure that the systems are well maintained and operating efficiently.\\n2) Consider checking Insulation refrigeration pipework on a frequent basis, insulation deteriorates over\\ntime and can lead to inefficiencies.\\n3) A maintenance regime is currently in place but no records were available on site. Evidence suggests\\nmaintenance is not regular or sufficient enough; grilles, filters, and terminal units are dirty. Increasing the\\nfrequency of maintenance will increase efficiency and lifetime of equipment.\\nControls\\n1) Consider providing guidance notices to staff on the general use of the system controllers. Limit who can\\nset and control the system.\\n2) Consider regularly checking that system temperature schedule programmes match current occupancy\\nrequirements. In non-critical areas lower heating set points to as low as possible, around 19 degrees\\nCelsius, and raise cooling set points to 25 degrees Celsius. Ensure controls strategy has a “dead band” of\\nat least 3 degrees Celsius between the need for cooling and the need for heating. Consider allowing\\ntemperatures in non-critical areas to fluctuate more widely than is traditionally expected but in a controlled\\nmanner. Refer to Carbon Trust CTG 005 Good Practice Guide.\\n3) Consider the use of PIR sensors for limited use rooms such as meeting rooms. The PIR sensor can\\ntrigger the room A/C unit and lighting upon occupancy and will automatically switch off the system when\\nthe room is empty. We advise that this is considered as part of an overall power saving and carbon emitting\\nreview.\\n4) Consider installing a central controller to allow timeclocking . Easy gains with regard to reducing energy\\nconsumption are available by ensuring that HVAC equipment is time scheduled and only operates when\\nrequired. Staff notices should be placed near timers to prevent unauthorised use. Consider whether to lock\\ntimers and allow only senior management to review.\\nManagement\\n1) Documentation; some necessary information could not be located during the inspection. It is strongly\\nrecommended that documentation is maintained in a building log book. It is recommended that all missing\\ndata is collated and storage and referencing of information is available for future inspections.\\n2) Consider installing sub metering to the plant to enable the recording of electricity consumption. The\\nbenefits of completing these works will be more compelling as energy monitoring can create immediate\\nsavings when combined with the use of latest technology. Introduce policy that all new electrical\\ninstallations should be fitted with Sub-meters as standard.29/05/2023, 18:24 Air conditioning inspection report – Find an energy certificate – GOV .UK\\nhttps://find-energy-certificate.service.gov .uk/energy-certificate/9666-5099-0025-0590-1895?print=true 5/30Subsystems inspected\\nVOL001 / SYS001 Gym 1.\\nVolume definitions VOL001\\nDescription 4No. R410a inverter driven RZQ140 twin split\\nsystems.\\nEffective rated cooling output 56 kW\\nArea served Gym 1.\\nInspection date 19 November 2012\\nCooling plant count 4\\nAHU count 0\\nTerminal units count 8\\nSub system controls count 4\\nVOL001 / SYS002 Male Changing.\\nVolume definitions VOL001\\nDescription 1No. R410a inverter driven RZQ140 twin split\\nsystem.\\nEffective rated cooling output 14 kW\\nArea served Male Changing.\\nInspection date 19 November 201229/05/2023, 18:24 Air conditioning inspection report – Find an energy certificate – GOV .UK\\nhttps://find-energy-certificate.service.gov .uk/energy-certificate/9666-5099-0025-0590-1895?print=true 6/30Cooling plant count 1\\nAHU count 0\\nTerminal units count 2\\nSub system controls count 129/05/2023, 18:24 Air conditioning inspection report – Find an energy certificate – GOV .UK\\nhttps://find-energy-certificate.service.gov .uk/energy-certificate/9666-5099-0025-0590-1895?print=true 7/30Pre-inspection records requested\\nEssential records\\nThese records were reviewed:\\nItemised list of installed air conditioning and refrigeration plant including product makes, models and\\nidentification numbers\\nCooling capacities, with locations of the indoor and outdoor components of each plant\\nDescription of method of control of temperature\\nFloor plans and schematics of air conditioning systems.\\nThese records were not available:\\nDescription of system control zones, with schematic drawings\\nDescription of method of control of periods of operation.\\nDesirable records\\nThese records were not available:\\nReports from earlier inspections of air conditioning systems, and for the generation of an energy\\nperformance certificate\\nRecords of maintenance operations carried out on refrigeration systems, including cleaning indoor and\\noutdoor heat exchangers, refrigerant leakage tests, repairs to refrigeration components replenishing\\nwith refrigerant\\nRecords of maintenance operations carried out on air delivery systems, including filter cleaning and\\nchanging, and cleaning of heat exchangers\\nRecords of calibration and maintenance operations carried out on control systems and sensors, or BMS\\nsystems and sensors\\nRecords of sub-metered air conditioning plant use or energy consumption\\nFor relevant air supply and extract systems, commissioning results of measured absorbed power at\\nnormal air delivery and extract rates, and commissioning results for normal delivered delivery and\\nextract air flow rates (or independently calculated specific fan power for the systems)\\nOptional records\\nThese records were not available:\\nAn estimate of the design cooling load for each system (if available).

      "Efficiency\n",
      "1) The systems appear appropriately sized for the cooling load.\n",
      "Maintenance\n",
      "1) Although some of the systems were found to contain less than 3Kg of refrigerant and are not required to\n",
      "comply with F-Gas regulations, good practice guidelines suggest that regular refrigerant leak checks are\n",
      "essential to ensure that the systems are well maintained and operating efficiently.\n",
      "2) Consider checking Insulation refrigeration pipework on a frequent basis, insulation deteriorates over\n",
      "time and can lead to inefficiencies.\n",
      "3) A maintenance regime is currently in place but no records were available on site. Evidence suggests\n",
      "maintenance is not regular or sufficient enough; grilles, filters, and terminal units are dirty. Increasing the\n",
      "frequency of maintenance will increase efficiency and lifetime of equipment.\n",
      "Controls\n",
      "1) Consider providing guidance notices to staff on the general use of the system controllers. Limit who can\n",
      "set and control the system.\n",
      "2) Consider regularly checking that system temperature schedule programmes match current occupancy\n",
      "requirements. In non-critical areas lower heating set points to as low as possible, around 19 degrees\n",
      "Celsius, and raise cooling set points to 25 degrees Celsius. Ensure controls strategy has a “dead band” of\n",
      "at least 3 degrees Celsius between the need for cooling and the need for heating. Consider allowing\n",
      "temperatures in non-critical areas to fluctuate more widely than is traditionally expected but in a controlled\n",
      "manner. Refer to Carbon Trust CTG 005 Good Practice Guide.\n",
      "3) Consider the use of PIR sensors for limited use rooms such as meeting rooms. The PIR sensor can\n",
      "trigger the room A/C unit and lighting upon occupancy and will automatically switch off the system when\n",
      "the room is empty. We advise that this is considered as part of an overall power saving and carbon emitting\n",
      "review.\n",
      "4) Consider installing a central controller to allow timeclocking . Easy gains with regard to reducing energy\n",
      "consumption are available by ensuring that HVAC equipment is time scheduled and only operates when\n",
      "required. Staff notices should be placed near timers to prevent unauthorised use. Consider whether to lock\n",
      "timers and allow only senior management to review.\n",
      "Management\n",
      "1) Documentation; some necessary information could not be located during the inspection. It is strongly\n",
      "recommended that documentation is maintained in a building log book. It is recommended that all missing\n",
      "data is collated and storage and referencing of information is available for future inspections.\n",
      "2) Consider installing sub metering to the plant to enable the recording of electricity consumption. The\n",
      "benefits of completing these works will be more compelling as energy monitoring can create immediate\n",
      "savings when combined with the use of latest technology. Introduce policy that all new electrical\n",

Festival Leisure Park, Festival Way, Basildon SS14 3WB. \\nThe subject building is a modern five storey semi-detached structure located in a business park area of \\nBasildon and operates as a gymnasium comprising of two floors of which the public and staff areas are \\ntreated space. Building occpancy hours are Monday to Thursday 0530 to 2300. Friday 0530 to 2100. \\nSaturday and Sunday 0700 to 2030.   \\nThe primary aim of the Report is to give the building owner, or operator, information about the performance \\nof the system and plant and to identify opportunities to save energy and cut operating costs. This Report \\nidentifies any operating anomalies; no-cost/low-cost savings; capital investment opportunities; the size and \\nappropriateness of refrigeration plant in relation to cooling loads and the effectiveness of current \\nmaintenance regimes.\\nIncluded within this report will be a description of the air conditioning services, system efficiencies and \\napproximate sizing of the system compared to industry guidelines and suggested improvements, which \\ncould be made to increase the system efficiency. The inspection and report will benefit the owner or \\nmanager only if its findings are acted upon.\\nWhilst some items with regard to Health and Safety may have been noted, this should not be taken as a \\ncomplete Report on Health and Safety. Similarly, whilst some items may refer to replacement of life expired \\nplant, this should not be taken as a complete life cycle replacement Report.\\nThe building is cooled by :\\n5No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG140L7Y1B condensers connected to 10No. Ceiling underslung \\ncassettes with hardwired controllers.  \\n5No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG140L7Y1B condensers connected to 10No. Ceiling cassettes with \\nhardwired controllers. \\n1No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG140L7Y1B condenser connected to 1No. Ceiling cassette with \\nhardwired controller. \\n1No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RZQG71L7Y1B condenser connected to 1No. Ceiling underslung \\ncassette with hardwired controller. \\n3No. Daikin R410a inverter driven RXS50J2V1B9 condensers connected to 3No. wall mounted cassette \\nwith hardwired controller. \\n1No. Daikin R410a inverter driven REYQ8P9Y1B VRV condenser connected to 8No. wall mounted \\ncassettes with hardwired controllers. \\nFor the purpose of the report samples have been taken in accordance with CIBSE TM44.

Evidence suggests\\nmaintenance is not regular or sufficient enough; grilles, filters, and terminal units are dirty. Increasing the\\nfrequency of maintenance will increase efficiency and lifetime of equipment.\\nControls\\n1) Consider providing guidance notices to staff on the general use of the system controllers. Limit who can\\nset and control the system.\\n2) Consider regularly checking that system temperature schedule programmes match current occupancy\\nrequirements. In non-critical areas lower heating set points to as low as possible, around 19 degrees\\nCelsius, and raise cooling set points to 25 degrees Celsius. Ensure controls strategy has a “dead band” of\\nat least 3 degrees Celsius between the need for cooling and the need for heating. Consider allowing\\ntemperatures in non-critical areas to fluctuate more widely than is traditionally expected but in a controlled\\nmanner. Refer to Carbon Trust CTG 005 Good Practice Guide.\\n3) Consider the use of PIR sensors for limited use rooms such as meeting rooms. The PIR sensor can\\ntrigger the room A/C unit and lighting upon occupancy and will automatically switch off the system when\\nthe room is empty. We advise that this is considered as part of an overall power saving and carbon emitting\\nreview.\\n4) Consider installing a central controller to allow timeclocking . Easy gains with regard to reducing energy\\nconsumption are available by ensuring that HVAC equipment is time scheduled and only operates when\\nrequired. Staff notices should be placed near timers to prevent unauthorised use. Consider whether to lock\\ntimers and allow only senior management to review.\\nManagement\\n1) Documentation; some necessary information could not be located during the inspection. It is strongly\\nrecommended that documentation is maintained in a building log book. It is recommended that all missing\\ndata is collated and storage and referencing of information is available for future inspections.\\n2) Consider installing sub metering to the plant to enable the recording of electricity consumption. The\\nbenefits of completing these works will be more compelling as energy monitoring can create immediate\\nsavings when combined with the use of latest technology. Introduce policy that all new electrical\\ninstallations should be fitted with Sub-meters as standard.29/05/2023, 18:24 Air conditioning inspection report – Find an energy certificate – GOV .UK\\nhttps://find-energy-certificate.service.gov .uk/energy-certificate/9666-5099-0025-0590-1895?print=true 5/30Subsystems inspected\\nVOL001 / SYS001 Gym 1.\\nVolume definitions VOL001\\nDescription 4No. R410a inverter driven RZQ140 twin split\\nsystems.\\nEffective rated cooling output 56 kW\\nArea served Gym 1.\\nInspection date 19 November 2012\\nCooling plant count 4\\nAHU count 0\\nTerminal units count 8\\nSub system controls count 4\\nVOL001 / SYS002 Male Changing.\\nVolume definitions VOL001\\nDescription 1No. R410a inverter driven RZQ140 twin split\\nsystem.\\nEffective rated cooling output 14 kW\\nArea served Male Changing.\\nInspection date 19 November 201229/05/2023, 18:24 Air conditioning inspection report – Find an energy certificate – GOV .UK\\nhttps://find-energy-certificate.service.gov .uk/energy-certificate/9666-5099-0025-0590-1895?print=true 6/30Cooling plant count 1\\nAHU count 0\\nTerminal units count 2\\nSub system controls count 129/05/2023, 18:24 Air conditioning inspection report – Find an energy certificate – GOV .UK\\nhttps://find-energy-certificate.service.gov .uk/energy-certificate/9666-5099-0025-0590-1895?print=true 7/30Pre-inspection records requested\\nEssential records\\nThese records were reviewed:\\nItemised list of installed air conditioning and refrigeration plant including product makes, models and\\nidentification numbers\\nCooling capacities, with locations of the indoor and outdoor components of each plant\\nDescription of method of control of temperature\\nFloor plans and schematics of air conditioning systems.\\nThese records were not available:\\nDescription of system control zones, with schematic drawings\\nDescription of method of control of periods of operation.\\nDesirable records\\nThese records were not available:\\nReports from earlier inspections of air conditioning systems, and for the generation of an energy\\nperformance certificate\\nRecords of maintenance operations carried out on refrigeration systems, including cleaning indoor and\\noutdoor heat exchangers, refrigerant leakage tests, repairs to refrigeration components replenishing\\nwith refrigerant\\nRecords of maintenance operations carried out on air delivery systems, including filter cleaning and\\nchanging, and cleaning of heat exchangers\\nRecords of calibration and maintenance operations carried out on control systems and sensors, or BMS\\nsystems and sensors\\nRecords of sub-metered air conditioning plant use or energy consumption\\nFor relevant air supply and extract systems, commissioning results of measured absorbed power at\\nnormal air delivery and extract rates, and commissioning results for normal delivered delivery and\\nextract air flow rates (or independently calculated specific fan power for the systems)\\nOptional records\\nThese records were not available:\\nAn estimate of the design cooling load for each system (if available).
