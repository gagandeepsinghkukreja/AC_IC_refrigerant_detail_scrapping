      "Efficiency\n",
      "1) The systems appear appropriately sized for the cooling load.\n",
      "Maintenance\n",
      "1) Although some of the systems were found to contain less than 3Kg of refrigerant and are not required to\n",
      "comply with F-Gas regulations, good practice guidelines suggest that regular refrigerant leak checks are\n",
      "essential to ensure that the systems are well maintained and operating efficiently.\n",
      "2) Consider checking Insulation refrigeration pipework on a frequent basis, insulation deteriorates over\n",
      "time and can lead to inefficiencies.\n",
      "3) A maintenance regime is currently in place but no records were available on site. Evidence suggests\n",
      "maintenance is not regular or sufficient enough; grilles, filters, and terminal units are dirty. Increasing the\n",
      "frequency of maintenance will increase efficiency and lifetime of equipment.\n",
      "Controls\n",
      "1) Consider providing guidance notices to staff on the general use of the system controllers. Limit who can\n",
      "set and control the system.\n",
      "2) Consider regularly checking that system temperature schedule programmes match current occupancy\n",
      "requirements. In non-critical areas lower heating set points to as low as possible, around 19 degrees\n",
      "Celsius, and raise cooling set points to 25 degrees Celsius. Ensure controls strategy has a “dead band” of\n",
      "at least 3 degrees Celsius between the need for cooling and the need for heating. Consider allowing\n",
      "temperatures in non-critical areas to fluctuate more widely than is traditionally expected but in a controlled\n",
      "manner. Refer to Carbon Trust CTG 005 Good Practice Guide.\n",
      "3) Consider the use of PIR sensors for limited use rooms such as meeting rooms. The PIR sensor can\n",
      "trigger the room A/C unit and lighting upon occupancy and will automatically switch off the system when\n",
      "the room is empty. We advise that this is considered as part of an overall power saving and carbon emitting\n",
      "review.\n",
      "4) Consider installing a central controller to allow timeclocking . Easy gains with regard to reducing energy\n",
      "consumption are available by ensuring that HVAC equipment is time scheduled and only operates when\n",
      "required. Staff notices should be placed near timers to prevent unauthorised use. Consider whether to lock\n",
      "timers and allow only senior management to review.\n",
      "Management\n",
      "1) Documentation; some necessary information could not be located during the inspection. It is strongly\n",
      "recommended that documentation is maintained in a building log book. It is recommended that all missing\n",
      "data is collated and storage and referencing of information is available for future inspections.\n",
      "2) Consider installing sub metering to the plant to enable the recording of electricity consumption. The\n",
      "benefits of completing these works will be more compelling as energy monitoring can create immediate\n",
      "savings when combined with the use of latest technology. Introduce policy that all new electrical\n",
